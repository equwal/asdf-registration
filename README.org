Register you directories in the ASDF subsystem. probably has a better way
to do it, but this one works.

* Install
Run the install script. If it complains, set =$CL_INIT= and =$ASDF_REPO=.
#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:equwal/asdf-registration.git
export CL_INIT="$HOME/.sbclrc" # for some SBCLs only.
export ASDF_REPO="$HOME/common-lisp" # This is where mine is.
sh asdf-registration/install.sh
#+end_src
* Advanced install
** More than one repository
  Add =asdf-registration:add-repo= lines to your init file. The subdirectories
  will be added to the ASDF registry.
** Directories not in a repository
   For an ASDF project not inside of a repository directory, use
   =asdf-registration:add-to-registry=.
* Guts
  ASDF-registration is a wrapper around the  =*central-registry*=.
